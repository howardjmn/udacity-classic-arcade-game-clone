=================================

This code is for ***[Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) - Project 3: Classic Arcade Game Clone***.

The game can be played by downloading all files and opening index.html in a browser, or directly in GitHub at

## Some Extras

* Player can select the game level.  With higher levels there are more bugs and they   move faster.
* Score is kept.  Avoiding all bugs and reaching the stream increases score, hitting a bug reduces score.
* Winning and losing scores are defined.
* A _Restart_ button is displayed after a game is won or lost.

## The Game

The game is a Frogger-clone, where the player starts at the bottom of
the board. The user has to move the player to the top of the board, over
the road into the stream, while avoiding enemies crossing the road.
When the player succeeds, or when the player has been hit by one of the
enemies, the game will be reset to the initial state.

You can try the game at the [GitHub Page](http://howardjmn.github.io/udacity-nd001-p3-classic-arcade-game-clone/)
